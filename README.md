# SHIIKSHA--Exam-Portal

An exam portal is an online platform where students can take exams, view their results and track their academic progress. In this project, we will build an exam portal using Spring Boot and Angular.

The backend of the exam portal will be built using Spring Boot, which is a popular Java framework for building web applications. We will use Spring Data JPA to connect to a MySQL database and store data related to exams, students, and their results.

On the frontend, we will use Angular, which is a modern JavaScript framework for building web applications. We will use Angular Material to design and style the user interface of the exam portal.
